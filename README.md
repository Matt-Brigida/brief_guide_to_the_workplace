[The presentation is here](https://matt-brigida.github.io/brief_guide_to_the_workplace/).

This presentation is *not*, and doesn't intend to be, a complete guide.  It is intended to make some points that the author thinks are not sufficiently made elsewhere.  It is also pure opinion---though I would say somewhat well informed opinion.
